## How do I approach designing software? 

My typical start to a project designing begins with an analysis of the requirements for the project presented. Breaking down each requirement of the project into separate smaller projects allows me to easily implement how a part of the project might be designed. From here, I may implement a project design document to help organize each part of the projects designs, especially if each portion is different from another. I will also implement researching best coding practices for specific designs of each requirement. This is a system I have used and will continue to use throughout future projects when implementing the designing phase.

## How do I approach developing programs? 

Similarly to how I approach the designing stage, I also breakdown the developmental phase into smaller projects of one big project. Important steps in this phase are getting requirements that are entirely necessary done first. The requirements that are a must are usually obtained during the designing phase with a interview with the consumer. Developing always starts with researching best coding practices and implementing them into the product to ensure security and functionality with the product. One a portion of the project is done, I start the next and slowly implement each portion into the final product until it works together like a cohesive clockwork. 

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 

My goals are simple, I want to become a software engineer. Studying computer science can help me to start to achieve my goal as well as gain an understanding of other aspects related to my goal that may or may not be apart of a future project. While my current stance to be a software engineer is firm, I am open to other careers surrounding computer sciene, whether it be game designing, web development, or database architecture, my mind is open to all areas of work related to computer science. Ultimately, my basic goal is a career in the tech industry.
